## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of this project is to develop a simple data management application using Laravel 9, designed to streamline the management and organization of project-related data. This application includes essential features such as user registration, email verification, login, and logout to ensure secure access. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on project records, which allows for efficient handling of project details. Additionally, the application supports file uploads with a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface, enabling users to manage and attach files to their projects seamlessly.

The user interface of the application is designed with flexibility, using Bootstrap or a free template to ensure an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design. The backend is structured using Laravel migrations to create and manage the database schema, ensuring that the data is well-organized and easy to maintain. This project aims to provide a robust yet simple solution for managing project information and associated files, enhancing productivity and data organization for users.
